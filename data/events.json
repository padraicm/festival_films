              "description": "Directed by Stijn Verhoeff and Sjoerd Leijten. This artistic reflection on being engaged with the world combines fiction and documentary, music and text to calls for a collective and activist approach to the climate crisis. Visually stunning, we follow an imaginative journey through an empty landscape where water meets land. Slowly the film moves away from the imaginary into the real to show environmental destruction, young activists occupying trees, and musicians at a farm leading to a short, but poignant sci-fi excursion at the end with a megaphone choir singing out: “The seas are rising and so are we!”  "

              "description": "Directed by Rose Madrone. How many times do you wonder if what you do makes a difference in the world?  Inspiring stories illustrating the ripple effects of our actions in an interconnected world. Like “What the Bleep Do We Know” meets “Cosmos” with Carl Sagan, the film unpacks what the Butterfly Effect really means. Even though a metaphor, it actually depicts how small actions can indeed have large effects. Would we act differently if we understood the interconnectedness at play all around us? .",
